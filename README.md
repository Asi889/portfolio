# Asaf Marom's Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website built with Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS. This portfolio showcases my creative work, projects, and achievements in the field of web development and design.

## Overview

This portfolio website serves as a showcase of my skills, projects, and experiences. It provides visitors with insights into my work and a way to get in touch with me for potential collaborations or job opportunities.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js:** A React framework for building server-rendered React applications.
- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- **[Other Technologies You Used]**: List any other key technologies you used, e.g., Firebase for hosting, GitHub for version control, etc.

## Features

- **Project Showcase:** Display your projects with descriptions, screenshots, and links.
- **About Me:** Share a brief bio and your professional journey.
- **Contact:** Provide a way for visitors to get in touch with you.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
